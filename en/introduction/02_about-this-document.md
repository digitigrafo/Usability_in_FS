##1.2 About this document

This document aims to be concise and at the same time include the essential info which I find important in working on the projects. Rather than theory and analysis of the current state, which is already widely discussed, I want to compile a set of actionable methods because this is what I see as lacking at the moment. 
It is in no way complete or fixed in its form, I encourage feedback and will evolve the document. 
As references, I use openly available sources so everyone is able to read up more on the same documents I use. Also to honor authors who make their material available to the community, much like free software developers. 
The subtitle is a reference to the four freedoms of free software (Stallman, 1986).
