#2.2 You are a developer

Awesome that you read this! This document should give you ideas and provide you with methods on how to improve the usability of your software. Even if there is no designer on your project, you can use many of the research methods yourself. 
One of the most important things in usability is that […] the product should target people whom [you] consider to be clueless newbies (Trudelle, 2002). Everything should be as clear and self-evident as possible (Krug, 2008). You already know the interface inside out and probably even designed it. Hence you tend to either overlook or simply not notice issues (Johansson, 2005). 
To learn more about general usability and develop an eye for issues, these blogs should go in your feed reader: 
Jakob Nielsen’s Alertbox: The guru of web usability, usability testing and low-cost usability methods. 
Little Big Details: The small interface details which are rarely noticed but help so much. 
UX Myths: The most common user experience misconceptions and why they are myths. 
Lukas Mathis’ ignore the code: He writes at the intersection of software engineering and user interface design.
