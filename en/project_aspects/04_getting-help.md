#3.4 Getting help

No matter how good you do your work, people will have problems, ask questions and report bugs. For them to be able to easily do that and also have the message reach you or the developers, there needs to be an easy platform. 
Many free software projects use Bugzilla for issue tracking â€“ it has a very difficult interface and a cumbersome registration process for reporting issues (Nichols & Twidale, 2003). A much better free software tool for support is Shapado which enables people to ask questions without registering. 
Ideally, a help platform like that should be directly included in your software.
