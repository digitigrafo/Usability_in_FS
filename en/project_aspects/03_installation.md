#3.3 Installation

How do advanced users and potential administrators of your software handle setting up your software? How do regular users go through the installation process? 
For web applications, the people setting the software up on their servers are most likely a completely different target group from the users themselves. Nevertheless technical terms should be reduced as well as options which are not immediately useful or can be set by default. 
It is possible in free software operating systems to install a package directly from repositories onto the computer. Many tutorials describe step by step how to add a personal package archive to repositories or how to pull applications from a Git version control repository and compile them. Even non-technical people can easily get your software through these guides and you have to cater your installation process to them as well.
