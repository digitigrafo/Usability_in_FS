#3. Project aspects

From searching information on the website and downloading the software over installation to actual usage, it is important to test every part. 
Users are not only people directly using the software but also for example interested people browsing the website, contributors willing to help and administrators hosting it. 
Especially in free & open source software, there are specific cases which appear more often than in proprietary software. For example setting it up on oneâ€™s own server when it is a web application. Or how to contribute to the project, an essence of free software. Also, support is mostly handled by the developers themselves rather than by a specific support team. 
Translations are managed by volunteers and might be faulty. Use distributed user testing and encourage other people to test your software in other languages as well. See 6.11 Call for testing.
