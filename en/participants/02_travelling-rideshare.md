#5.2 Traveling, rideshare, hostel
Testing while traveling is great because you meet lots of different people. There is a vast array of potential test participants readily available. It doesn’t matter if it’s in a car, on a plane, bus or train, in a hostel or anywhere else you are staying or traveling. 
You just have to strike up a conversation with someone. Ask them if they are interested in testing a software. For these unplanned tests you should have your own laptop with you. When they agree, just continue with 6.10 Watch people use the software. 
When you don’t have that much time or the hardware for an interface test, a casual talk already works fine. The best method here is 6.5 Benchmark opinions where you just talk to people about the software they currently use and their experience with it. 
The problem of people becoming »professional testers« will practically not occur since you mostly see the people you meet while traveling only once. There should be no problem to find 3–5 people with wildly varying professions and technological backgrounds.
