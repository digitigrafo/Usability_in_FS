#7.3 Tag bugs
Use tags in the project’s bug tracking system to identify and group issues according to common interface problems. This is similar to applying heuristics in review and you can use the same terminology for that. See 6.3 Review. 
For this to work correctly not everyone should be able to set general »usability« tags but there needs to be a person or team coordinating the review and tagging of those bugs or supposed usability issues will clutter the tracker (Trudelle, 2002). 
Existing bugs should be reviewed and identified according to their specific usability problem. If it is apparent that the fix for a problem is very trivial, additionally use the paper cut tag. See 7.4 Identify paper cuts. 
Tagging bugs helps quantify usability issues and make them apparent to developers in an objective way: 
Just as developers currently have a shared vocabulary to describe good and bad with concepts such as performance, data loss, and crashing, usability heuristics can introduce additional concepts, like consistency, jargon, and feedback. 
Faaborg (2010a)
Publicly dealing with usability in a way that is highly visible to developers contributes to the project being perceived as caring for user experience and can attract new developers interested in that.
