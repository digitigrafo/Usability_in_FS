#7.2 List tasks
The next step from listing issues is analyzing the problems, derive suggestions from them and have actionable tasks to fix the issues. 
The tasks should also be sorted by the section of the application they refer to. If the project has an issue tracking system where feature requests are tracked as well, use that for listing and prioritizing the tasks. If there are easy tasks, tag them accordingly. This will also attract potential contributors (Ã‡etin et al., 2006).
