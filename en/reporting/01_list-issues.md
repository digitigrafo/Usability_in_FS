It is not important who had a specific issue but much more how many people ran into it. If there is issue overlap, it is directly visible and can be marked as affecting more people. 
When collaborating with more testers or in a user experience team, it is useful to use a collaborative editor like the free software web application EtherPad to collect results. You can get free team spaces and pads at the community-maintained TitanPad.
