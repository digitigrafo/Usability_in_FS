#7.5 Provide guidelines
Generalize the look and elements used in the application. It should be easy for existing developers and new contributors to make the interface consistent just by following some basic style guide. 
You can find more sophisticated human interface guidelines for some projects available online: 
GNOME, KDE, Android & OLPC 
Mac OS X & iOS 
Windows 7 & Windows Phone 
While these are very extensive, in the beginning it is enough to document design decisions and their reasons to compile a quick design introduction.
