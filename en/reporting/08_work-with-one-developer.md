#7.8 Work with one developer
Find a developer willing to partner with you on a combined usability session and coding sprint. You can have quick iterations to implement interface ideas, fix problems or evaluate the results of the usability testing session. 
In the process, you can learn about development and the developer will learn about your work. In making your work directly visible to other developers you build trust and make it more likely for them to respect your suggestions and eventually implement them (Andreasen et al., 2006). 
Do this one-on-one working with every main developer at least once to get them accustomed to user-centered design. That way you also learn how each developer thinks about the methodology and how you can help them make interfaces easier to use from the outset.
