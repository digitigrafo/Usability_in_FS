#7. Reporting
An advantage of free software development is the agile communication. You are able to report your results fast, without needing to compile a report or presentation. You can directly speak to the developers about it and make fast iterations based on suggestions. This allows for lots of small tests helping to gradually improve the interface. 
Ideally, you should directly give suggestions on how to improve the interface. As Lewis (2006) mentions, usability issues need to be interpreted with caution. There should always be follow-up tests to check if the changes had a good effect on usability. 
[â€¦] usability practitioners must conduct their usability tests as carefully as possible, document their methods completely, and show proper caution when interpreting their results. 
Lewis (2006, p. 6)
To prioritize issues, Nielsen (2005b) suggests rating their severity, judging from: 
How frequent the issue occurs. Would it happen to everyone? 
How it impacts the user. Is it easy to circumvent or difficult? 
How persistent an issue is. Will users have that issue repeatedly?
