#4.2 Test object

When you test a specific application make sure you have the latest version or development master. Having some knowledge of the version control system used by the project, for example Git, is also helpful. You can always pull the latest development version, check out new features and analyze their performance while they are developed. 
In the case of a web application, you should host an instance of the software or organize one to be hosted. Prepare user accounts in case people are not comfortable registering. 
For testing a desktop application on your own hardware, it is best if you set up a fresh installation. Then you can tell the participants that they can’t break anything and they will already be more relaxed even though it is unfamiliar hardware. 
When testing on the participants’ hardware, you can go through the whole process of downloading, installation, first impression and identify more issues which naturally occur there.
