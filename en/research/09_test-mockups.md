#6.9 Test mockups

The earlier you find issues with your design, the easier it is to fix them. Every problem you fix with a pencil on paper is a problem you don’t have to fix in code. 
Mathis (2011, p. 110)
To test the feasibility of a design in the planning phase, test mockups on people. Give them a realistic task, be general and don’t hint at the functionality of the software. 
It is important to not only show the mockup to people but actually go through a scenario. Nielsen (2001) advises: If the users have not actually tried to use the designs, they’ll base their comments on surface features. Such input often contrasts strongly with feedback based on real use.
During and after the tasks you can ask them follow-up questions for them to clarify their impression of the design. 
What is your first impression? What do you like? What do you dislike? 
What is this about? 
What would you do first? 
What do you expect behind [links]? 
Do you miss information? 
If you described this to a friend, what would you say?
