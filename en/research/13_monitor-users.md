#6.13 Monitor users

I was actually very hesitant to include this since I highly value privacy. I kept it since results are anonymized and aggregated. 
For the web application and web site of the project you can use the free & open source ClickHeat suite. It can be hosted on the same server and included in the site you want to monitor via JavaScript snippet. 
This can help prioritize feature development and fixes. In a heatmap test with the public Nextcloud demo it was apparent that the search box was not used even a single time and is thus lower in priority â€“ or not properly findable.
