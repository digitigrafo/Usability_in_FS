#6.7 Ask users

Getting feedback can be as simple as that – just asking people what they love or hate. Really use the terms »love« and »hate« to get out the most severe things first. But you always have to filter out the actual issues from predictions as Nielsen (2001) notes. This is especially important with "loud users":

    User feedback can be great, but some are more loud than representative and paint their needs and assessments as those of a supposed majority.
