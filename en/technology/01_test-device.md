#4.1 Test device

As mentioned in 3.2 Application itself already, test on different devices. Especially when the project is a web application, you need to make sure it works fine on big and small screens as well as touchscreens of tablets and smartphones. 
When you don’t have access to a specific device, it’s very easy nowadays to find people who use them regularly. 
Letting people use their own hardware has the upside that they won’t be distracted by any issues with the hardware or the software setup itself. Getting accustomed to your device will waste some time. You always have to consider that when issues come up. 
When you use your own hardware always have clean installations of programs that need to be used, for example deactivate all browser plugins when you test a web application.
