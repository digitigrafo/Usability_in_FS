    "description": "For a software to truly be free, people need to be able to easily use it without help. This is a quick start to usability testing in a distributed and independent development environment: A collection of usability methods applicable especially in free & open source software projects. No matter if you are a developer, usability person or just enthusiastic about making software easier to use, this document should help you get going. This started out in Summer 2011 as a bachelor’s thesis concluding my studies of information design at Stuttgart Media University. The original title was Coordinating low-cost usability testing in independent free & open source software projects. Now it’s an open document, everyone can use it & contribute. ",
